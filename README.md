# Video recommendations

Users and video data is provided in a series of csv files. The task is to write code that uses
the available data to provide recommendations of videos that a specific user might be interested
in watching.

* Read data from the files (the `DataSources` class can help you a bit)
* Process and model the data to support your decision-making
* Implement `VideoRecommendationService::getTop3RecommendedVideos`
